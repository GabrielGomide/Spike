# Spike

Spike is a GUI library for the pygame library.
<br>
This should be used to handle the frames, buttons, text inputs and menus in a pygame game.

## Colors

Manually typing tuples with rgb values looks pretty ugly.
<br>
That's why Spike has a file just to deal with colors.
<br>
We've already declared the colors black, white, red, green, blue, cyan, pink, yellow, orange, purple, grey and brown.
<br>
```python
import spike
# Some code
surface.fill(spike.RED)
# Some more code
```
<br>
More examples: examples/colors.py and examples/random_colors.py
